### Abstract 

We address in this work the problem of document clustering. Our approach is based on the following pipeline. First, we quantify the topics in a document. Then, a number of clusters is set automatically. Finally, a multi-criteria distance is defined to cluster the documents. The advantage of this approach is that it allows us to have a number of multi-criteria clusters based on structural analysis of each document. We have applied our method on Twitter data and showed the accuracy of our results compared to a random choice number of clusters.
